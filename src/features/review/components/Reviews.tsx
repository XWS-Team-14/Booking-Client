This villa sits in a quiet fishing village right upon the waterfront without cars or tourism immediately around, yet proximity to Kotor is 10 minutes and many adventures are out the door. The villa is finished to a very high standard with smartly chosen, minimalist furnishings and high end appliances. Adventure abounds with a Stunning hike up the fjord behind the village to Ivanâ€™s church or a peaceful paddle board followed by a swim in the ocean, jacuzzi soak, and wine on the patio. The communication and welcome were delightful. I hope you love this special gem as much as I do!" //item.content
